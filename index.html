                 <h2>How to Use the Simple Interest Calculator?</h2>
                 <p>The procedure to use the simple interest calculator is as follows:<br>

                   <strong> Step 1:</strong> Enter the principal, interest rate, number of years in the respective input field<br>
                    
                   <strong>Step 2:</strong> Now click the button “CALCULATE” to get the simple interest<br>
                    
                    <strong> Step 3: </strong>Finally, the simple interest for the given amount will be displayed in the output field</p><br>
                    <br>
                    <h2>What is Meant by Simple Interest?</h2>
                    <p>In mathematics, simple interest is the method of calculating the interest for the principal/loan amount. Simple interest is used in most of the sectors such as finance, banking, automobiles, and so on. If the principal amount, interest rate, and the time period are given, the simple interest can be easily calculated. The formula to calculate the simple interest is given by<br>

                       <strong>Simple Interest, SI = (P×R×T)/100</strong><br>
                        
                        Where,
                        <br>
                        P – Principal amount
                        <br>
                        R – Rate of interest
                        <br>
                        T – Time period (Number of years)<br></p>

               <h2> COMPOUND INTEREST </h2><br>
               <p><strong>Compound interest is the interest imposed on a loan or deposit amount. It is the most commonly used concept in our daily existence. The compound interest for an amount depends on both Principal and interest gained over periods. This is the main difference between compound and simple interest.
>
                Suppose we observe our bank statements, we generally notice that some interest is credited to our account every year. This interest varies with each year for the same principal amount. We can see that interest increases for successive years. Hence, we can conclude that the interest charged by the bank is not simple interest; this interest is known as compound interest or CI. In this article, you will learn what CI is, formula and derivation of formula to calculate the CI when compounded annually, half-yearly, quarterly, etc. Also, one can understand why the return on compound interest is more than the return on simple interest through the examples given based on real-life applications of CI here.  </strong></p>
                <h2>Compound Interest In Maths</h2>
                <p>In Maths, Compound interest can be calculated in different ways for different situations. We can use the interest formula of compound interest to ease the calculations. To calculate compound interest, we need to know the amount and principal. It is the difference between amount and principal.</p>
             <h2>Compound Interest Formula</h2>
             <p>As we have already discussed, the compound interest is the interest-based on the initial principal amount and the interest collected over the period of time.  The compound interest formula is given below:
               <br> Where,
<br>
                A = amount<br>
                P = principal<br>
                r = rate of interest<br>
                n = number of times interest is compounded per year<br>
                t = time (in years)<br>
                Alternatively, we can write the formula as given below:<br>
                
                CI = A – P<br>
                
                And
                <br>
               <strong> CI= P(pow(1+r/(n*100),nt))-p</strong>
                 <br>
                 <br>
                This formula is also called periodic compounding formula.
                <br><br>
                Here,
                <br><br>
                A represents the new principal sum or the total amount of money after compounding period<br>
                P represents the original amount or initial amount<br>
                r is the annual interest rate<br>
                n represents the compounding frequency or the number of times interest is compounded in a  year<br>
                t represents the number of years<br>
                It is to be noted that the above formula is the general formula for the number of times the principal is compounded in a year. If the interest is compounded annually, the amount is given as:<br>
                
               <strong>A= P(pow(1+r/100),t)</strong>
                 
                <br> 
                Thus, the compound interest rate formula can be expressed for different scenarios such as the interest rate is compounded yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, daily, etc.
